# Customer-Segmentation-and-Transaction-Analysis

# Overview
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning (ML) techniques for customer segmentation and transaction analysis, enabling businesses to derive actionable insights for improved decision-making. The goal is to process transaction data and apply clustering methods like K-Means and DBSCAN to identify customer segments based on their spending behavior and purchase patterns.

By understanding customer behavior, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize product offerings. The project uses invoice data to create customer-level data and then applies clustering techniques to uncover patterns in the data.

# Project Breakdown
 Part 1:
 K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation
In this part, we use K-Means clustering to group customers based on their total spending. The main steps include:
  Data Preprocessing: Convert transaction data to customer-level data, calculate total spending per customer, and aggregate other relevant features (e.g., first purchase, last purchase, most common location).
  Feature Scaling: Standardize the spending feature to prepare for clustering.
  Clustering: Apply K-Means clustering to group customers into distinct segments based on their spending behavior.
  Analysis: Analyze the resulting clusters to understand the customer segments and generate actionable insights for business strategy.


Part 2: 
DBSCAN Clustering for Identifying Natural Groupings and Outliers
In this part, we use DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to identify customer segments based on both total spending and purchase intervals. The main steps include:
Data Preprocessing: Similar to Part 1, but including the calculation of the purchase interval (time between the first and last purchase).
Feature Scaling: Standardize both the total spending and purchase interval features.
Clustering with DBSCAN: Use DBSCAN to identify clusters and noise points (outliers).
Analysis and Visualization: Visualize the clustering results and summarize the findings, including the identification of outliers.

# Key Features:
K-Means Clustering: Groups customers based on spending behavior for targeted marketing.
DBSCAN Clustering: Detects outliers and identifies clusters with varying densities.
Customer-Level Aggregation: Transforms transaction-level data into customer-level insights.
Visualization: Visualize the clustering results with scatter plots.

# Tools and Libraries Used
Pandas: Data manipulation and aggregation.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms (K-Means and DBSCAN), StandardScaler for feature scaling.
Matplotlib: Data visualization.
Jupyter Notebooks: (Optional) For interactive analysis and step-by-step code execution.


# Project Insights
Customer segmentation is vital for businesses to enhance customer targeting, increase retention, and improve overall profitability.
The project explores different clustering techniques and demonstrates how to use machine learning for real-world business applications.
Key insights from the clustering can guide marketing strategies, personalized offers, and business decision-making.
